		<h2>LeanBiome Ingredients</h2>
		<p>LeanBiome contains 11 active ingredients, including green tea extract, inulin, and 9 probiotic strains. Each ingredient tackles weight loss in a different way.
		<br /><br />
		Here’s how each of the three active ingredient types in LeanBiome helps you lose weight:
		<br /><br />
		<strong>Probiotics:</strong> LeanBiome contains significant doses of probiotic strains like lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus rhamnosus. 
		These probiotics thrive in your digestive tract, where they help break down the foods you eat, support good immune health, 
		and make it easier to lose weight. Bad gut health makes it difficult to lose weight. It also makes you feel sluggish and weak. 
		By taking a probiotic supplement like LeanBiome, you can support gut health and probiotic levels in your gut, 
		making it easier to lose weight and support overall health. LeanBiome contains 20 billion colony forming units (CFUs) of probiotics in a time-delayed capsule, 
		making it easier for the active ingredients to reach your digestive tract and thrive.
		<br /><br />
		<strong>Prebiotics:</strong> LeanBiome contains a single prebiotic: inulin from chicory root. It’s one of the most popular prebiotic sources available today. 
		Inulin is a natural plant extract that fuels the good bacteria (the probiotics) in your digestive tract. 
		95% of Americans don’t get their daily recommended intake of fiber, which means you’re driving your gut bacteria of valuable nutrients. 
		LeanBiome contains a significant dose (200mg) of inulin to feed your gut bacteria and support good overall health.
		<br /><br />
		<strong>Green Tea Extract:</strong> LeanBiome contains a specific type of green tea extract called Greenselect Phytosome. 
		That green tea extract is rich with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a natural chemical with antioxidant effects. 
		Studies show that the EGCG is green tea extract can provide significant weight loss benefits. Green tea extract is also rich with caffeine and L-theanine, 
		two other ingredients linked to weight loss and overall health. By taking the green tea extract in LeanBiome daily, 
		you can support good diet and exercise habits while making it easier to lose weight.
		<br /><br />
		Together, these three types of ingredients in LeanBiome make it easier to lose weight by supporting your gut from the inside out. 
		While other diet pills flood your body with stimulants or weird herbal extracts, LeanBiome focuses on supporting good digestive health and building outward from there.

		<h2>How Much Weight Can You Lose with LeanBiome?</h2>
		<p>The makers of LeanBiome claim thousands of people are already losing weight with LeanBiome, enjoying “rapid and sustained fat loss” just by taking one capsule of LeanBiome daily.

		In fact, Lean for Good claims you can lose weight with the formula even without eating right or exercising. The company insists you can continue eating all your favorite foods, for example, while still enjoying rapid and sustained weight loss.
		<br /><br />
		Here are some of the weight loss claims found on LeanLifeNow.com:
		<br /><br />

		At LeanLifeNow.com, you’ll discover the story of Megan C, who lost 240lbs in 17 months by activating her fat burning switch using the ingredients in LeanBiome.

		Lean for Good cites a study where patients taking one ingredient in LeanBiome lost 8.5% of their belly fat in 12 weeks. According to Lean for Good, that means the average American woman weighing 170lbs would lose 15lbs of belly fat in just 3 months “doing nothing else” while taking LeanBiome.

		In a separate study on lactobacillus rhamnosus, a group lost an average of 9.7lbs of fat in 12 weeks.
		
		<br><br>

		Another study found lactobacillus fermentum led to a 3% drop in body fat in just 43 days compared to just 1% for the placebo group, or triple the fat loss in 6 weeks.

		In a study on Greenselect Phytosome, participants lost 30lbs in 12 weeks while following a calorie-restricted diet. A group following the same diet without the green tea extract only lost 11lbs.
		
		
		Overall, Lean for Good seems confident LeanBiome can lead to significant, rapid, and sustained weight loss results in a short period of time regardless of your diet and exercise habits.
